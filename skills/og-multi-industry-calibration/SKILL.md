  Builds or reviews a multi-industry (M>1) OG-Core country calibration from a SAM or input-output
  tables and keeps it consistent with the single-industry model. Use when deriving alpha_c,
  io_matrix, industry capital shares, sector TFP or sector tax rates; packaging the multisector
  overlay; solving a multi-industry steady state by continuation; or comparing single- and
  multi-industry results.

# Multi-industry calibration for an OG-Core country model

A multi-industry model is a second representation of the same economy as the single-industry
model. Most of the work is not deriving numbers from a SAM; it is making sure the two models still
describe the same country, and getting a stiff model to solve. OG-Core ships the machinery and no
guidance on any of this; the method here is the family's own.

**Prerequisite:** the single-industry calibration is settled first (og-country-calibration). The
multi model inherits every economy-wide value from it, and its fiscal and macro moments are judged
against it.

**Run rules:** follow [og-run-rules.md](references/og-run-rules.md): under ten minutes for a
healthy single-industry baseline, the example-script pattern, always parallel, Anderson with
`nu` ≤ 0.2, preflight, and the user's explicit go before any solve beyond a quick check.

## Where the worked code is

Three calibrations solved different parts of the problem. Read the code on each repo's
multi-industry branch, not only its docs; docs and code disagree in places in all three.

| Repo | Data | Read it for |
|---|---|---|
| OG-PHL (the reference) | IFPRI SAM, one activity per commodity | Builder, overlay and tests; the chi conversion; the continuation solver and `validate_ss`; the composite-price experiment; the practitioner guide `docs/single_multi_calibration_guide.md` |
| OG-ZAF | UNU-WIDER SAM, several activities per commodity | Make/use Leontief from a raw SAM; employment splits; the Z-level rescale to the single model's `factor`; a cold solve |
| OG-BRA (the most developed) | Input-output tables with a published domestic Leontief | The mixed-income split; exact domestic tracing; per-good `tau_c` and per-industry CIT; funded public capital; the M=1 equivalence test; the concordance test |

OG-IDN and OG-ETH carry only the upstream scaffold (naive `io_matrix`, one `gamma` copied to every
industry, `Z` = 1). Do not treat their multisector files as worked examples.

## The ladder

Each input has a minimal and a better rung. Take the highest the data supports, and say which in
the docs.

| Input | Minimal | Better | Best seen |
|---|---|---|---|
| `io_matrix` | direct-use shares | value-added trace through a Leontief inverse you build | published domestic tables, no import assumption (BRA) |
| `gamma_m` | single `gamma` everywhere | SAM factor shares rescaled to the single model's level | plus a per-industry mixed-income split (BRA) |
| `Z_m` | 1 everywhere | Solow residual with survey employment | same, with capital allocated consistently with `gamma` |
| taxes | single-model scalars | — | per-good `tau_c` from the use table, per-industry CIT from collections (BRA) |
| solve | cold | continuation from a flat anchor | — |

## What matters most

- **Ship a lean overlay**, loaded after the single-industry base and written by a builder. Loaded
  alone it silently falls back to US defaults.
- **Check that the mapping partitions the data.** Unmapped or misspelled codes vanish from every sum
  without an error; two of three repos shipped one.
- **The capital-goods producer goes last** (OG-Core's numeraire, and the only producer of investment
  and government goods). Fold real estate into a broader group.
- **Trace `io_matrix` through value added**, with algebra that fits the data (one producer per
  commodity or several). The naive matrix puts most goods on manufacturing.
- **Take `gamma`'s level from the single model** and the dispersion from the data.
- **Convert `chi_n` and `chi_b` by `k^(σ−1)`** for OG-Core's unnormalised composite price. In PHL it
  closed half to four fifths of the gaps to the single model.
- **Prove the plumbing with the equivalence test**: identical industries must reproduce M=1.
- **`factor` is the best single number for a level misalignment.** Use the Z level to align
  `factor`, never to close `r` or `K_f/K` gaps.
- **Try a cold solve; fall back to continuation** when relative prices spread widely.
- **Run the same reform through both models** and compare the percent-change tables.

## Checklist

Copy this into the work log.

```
- [ ] 1.  Single-industry model settled; note its gamma + gamma_g, tau_c, CIT, factor and seeds.
- [ ] 2.  Look for existing work first: the repo's multi-industry branch, open PRs, and open
          OG-Core work touching io_matrix or the composite price (alignment.md, "When OG-Core
          changes").
- [ ] 3.  Data: find the SAM or IO tables; check make structure, domestic vs total use, totals,
          year; validate against the national accounts (inputs.md).
- [ ] 4.  Concordances and industries: partition test + run-time assert; capital-goods producer
          last; real estate folded in.
- [ ] 5.  Inputs: alpha_c, gamma_m (mixed-income split if available, rescale to the single's
          level, then carve out gamma_g), io_matrix (value-added trace), L_m, Z_m; sector taxes
          only if published.
- [ ] 6.  Builder writes the overlay; chi conversion from alpha_c and the base sigma; Anderson
          and nu in the overlay; seeds stay in the base.
- [ ] 7.  Tests: overlay keys, JSON == builder, two-step load, chi conversion, concordance,
          row sums, equivalence test.
- [ ] 8.  Solve: cold first; continuation if it fails; structural checks after every solve.
- [ ] 9.  Align: comparison dashboard against the single; factor first; Z-level rescale only for
          factor.
- [ ] 10. Same reform through both models; signs and magnitudes agree.
- [ ] 11. Docs (sources and methods, interpretation caveats) and the PR (og-country-calibration's
          calibration-pr.md).
```

Loop-backs:
- **The equivalence test fails** → the overlay, the chi conversion or the mapping is wrong. Fix it
  before any calibrated solve; nothing downstream is interpretable until it passes.
- **`factor` is far off** → a level misalignment upstream (often the `gamma` target or the chi
  conversion). Fix it before reading any other gap.
- **The single model is recalibrated** → rebuild the overlay and re-solve both models in the same
  change; update any numbers one model's docs quote about the other.
- **One industry's Z is wildly out of line** → its employment number (step 5).
- **The reform disagrees in sign between the models** → back to step 9; do not ship.

opening PRs and anything across several repos are proposed and wait for the user. Ask before push
