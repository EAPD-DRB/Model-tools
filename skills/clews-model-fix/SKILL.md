# Fix a CLEWs model structurally

For changes that **cannot change any solved value**. These need a mechanical precondition
check and a change record — not a calibration plan, not a control run, not an A/B test, not
a re-solve.

If the change is not in scope below, stop and hand off. Do not widen this skill.

## Triage first

| Class | Test | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| **A — structural** | No parameter value changes and no source data changes | **this skill** |
| **B — sourced parameter change** | A number changes, chosen *without* reference to an observed outcome | `calibrate-clews-model`, with provenance |
| **C — calibration** | A value chosen *with reference to* an observed outcome | `calibrate-clews-model`, full plan |

The discriminator is the counterfactual test: *would this exact change still be made if no
historical outcome were known?* For a Class A fix the answer is trivially yes. Full rules in
[references/non-forcing.md](references/non-forcing.md).

## In scope

- Delete an unreferenced `TEC_`, `COM_` or `EMI_`.
- Delete an orphaned or stranded commodity.
- Replace a placeholder description (`TBD`, `xxx`, a repeated stub).
- Add or change a `TECHGROUP` assignment. Grouping is interface metadata and must not alter
  parameters.
- Add a deterministic time-set description.
- Correct a cosmetic label.

## Out of scope — stop and say which skill applies

- **Any change to a numeric parameter value** → Class B.
- **Deleting an object that is still referenced** → the solution changes. Class B/C.
- **A unit correction that implies a conversion** → that is a calculation. Class B.
- **Anything chosen by looking at a historical outcome** → Class C.
- A description that encodes a modelling claim rather than a label → treat as Class B.

## Procedure

1. **Gate.** Prove the object is referenced nowhere but its own definition:

   ```bash
   python audit.py MODEL_DIR --removable TEC_x --json diagnostics/removable.json
   ```

   Exit 0 means removable. Exit non-zero names the files that still reference it — read
   them. If a reference is itself dead, that is a second Class A change: clear it first,
   re-run the gate, and record both.

   `audit.py` collects referenced IDs from every `*.json` except `genData.json`, so this
   covers activity ratios, costs, bounds, emission ratios and UDC coefficient files. Never
   substitute "it has no input/output ratio" for this gate — a dangling technology can still
   carry a capital cost with a minimum-capacity bound, and deleting that *would* change the
   objective.

2. **Back up**, then make the edit in the case JSON. Never hand-edit `data.txt`, processed
   data, LP/MPS files, solver output, result CSVs or Pivot output.

3. **Confirm.** Re-run `python audit.py MODEL_DIR`. Require: the ID is gone, no new
   findings, and no finding that was absent before.

4. **Record.** One row in `CHANGES.csv`
   ([references/SCHEMA.md](references/SCHEMA.md)) with `class=A`,
   the objects removed, `evidence_path` pointing at the gate output from step 1, and
   `resolve_status=objective_unchanged`. Add one dated line to
   `documentation/HISTORY.md` naming the `change_id`.

5. **Retire lineage, never delete it.** If a removed object had a `MODEL_MAP.csv` row, set
   its `superseded_by` to the `change_id`. Do not delete the row — an earlier model version
   must stay reconstructable.

## No re-solve

When the step 1 gate passes, nothing in the model referenced the object, so no constraint
and no objective term contained it. The solved values cannot change, and re-solving to
prove that is waste.

If a deliverable needs regenerated artifacts, regenerate them and assert the objective is
**identical**. That is packaging, not verification. A changed objective after a passing
gate means the gate was wrong — stop and investigate rather than accepting the new number.

## Done when

- the removability gate exited 0, and its output is retained;
- the post-change audit shows no new findings;
- `CHANGES.csv` has a `class=A` row naming that evidence;
- any affected `MODEL_MAP.csv` row is marked superseded, not deleted;
- `HISTORY.md` names the change.

`SOURCES.csv`, `CALCULATIONS.csv` and `ASSUMPTIONS.csv` are correctly untouched: a Class A
change introduces no source, no calculation and no assumption. That is not a provenance
gap — there is no lineage to record, because no data entered the model.
